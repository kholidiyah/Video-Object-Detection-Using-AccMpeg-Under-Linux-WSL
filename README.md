# Video-Object-Detection-Using-AccMpeg-Under-Linux-WSL
This repository contains an implementation of a Video Object Detection system utilizing AccMpeg, designed to run seamlessly on Linux-WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). The project focuses on optimizing video analytics workflows by leveraging advanced video compression techniques and efficient object detection algorithms.
# Features:
- AccMpeg Integration: Utilize custom configurations to optimize video compression parameters (FPS, QP, resolution, entropy coding, etc.) for enhanced detection accuracy and reduced bandwidth.
- PyTorch Trainer: Includes a custom PyTorch trainer for training and fine-tuning object detection models.
- Linux-WSL Compatibility: Full compatibility with Linux-WSL for development and deployment in hybrid environments.
- Scalable Performance: Designed to handle large-scale video datasets efficiently, making it suitable for applications in video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and smart city analytics.
# Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- AccMpeg (custom codec tool)
